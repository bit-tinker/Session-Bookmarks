		<h1>What? Why? How?</h1>
		<div>
			You used the Window Saver extension to open a window 
			containing a tab with a restricted page.
			Firefox prevents extensions from manipulating restricted pages for security reasons.
		</div>
		<div>
			Window Saver is therefore able to save such pages, but not to restore them. This placeholder is the best it can do.
			To access the saved page simply copy the URL above and paste it into the address bar.
		</div>
		<div>
			You can use Firefox's inbuilt bookmark menus to restore saved windows as well. 
			Doing so requires a few more steps, but if there are many restricted tabs in a saved window
			it might be a preferable option for this window.
			The quickest way to do so is the following:
			<ol>
				<li>Open a new Firefox window (CTRL+N)</li>
				<li>Open the Bookmarks Sidebar (CTRL+B)</li>
				<li>Expand the Master Folder (default: 'Window Saver' in 'Other Bookmarks') with a left-click</li>
				<li>Right-click on the saved window and choose 'Open All in Tabs' to restore it</li>
			</ol>
